        <h2>Featured project: SKY Campus Happiness Program</h2>
        <p>The <b>SKY Campus Happiness Program</b> is a total well-being program designed to help students, faculty and staff achieve their fullest potential.</p>
        <p>My website provides details about the program content, how it will be conducted, when it is being offered, and the requirements to complete the program. It also provides background information about the instructors who are conducting this program.</p>
        <p>Since most people use mobile devices to sign up for programs and workshops, it was necessary to redesign my website to make it responsive and lay out the content such that it flowed vertically and eliminated horizontal scrolling. I also had to adjust colors and font sizes to make my website accessible to a diverse audience.</p>
