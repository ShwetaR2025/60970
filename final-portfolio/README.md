## Reflection
Prior to taking this course, I had no knowledge of how websites were developed. This course introduced me to a foreign world of HTML and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). It helped me understand how desktop versions of websites are very different from the mobile versions of websites. It taught me how to transform the desktop version of my website into a mobile-friendly version. I learnt how to incorporate responsive design into my website to enable it to work on all devices. 
Many websites assume that more information is better, overlooking the fact that website users tend to get lost when there is information overload, leading to frustration and eventually forcing them to explore other resources. Accessibility is another area of website development that tends to take a backseat and is more often than not provided as an afterthought, leading to shabbily designed and hard to use websites. This course taught me how to use modern layout techniques to make my website easily navigable and to implement accessibility by providing alternative text, keyboard navigation, device appropriate colors and fonts etc.
I intend to leverage this learning in my future website development endeavors.
