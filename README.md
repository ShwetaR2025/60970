Web authoring for mobile devices

## Steps taken to make web site mobile friendly
- Broke up long, wordy paragraphs into a simpler and concise structure to deliver content effectively on mobile devices.
- Used bulleted format to highlight key points.
- Restructured content to flow vertically so as to avoid horizontal scrolling.
- Adjusted font sizes based on the device the content is being displayed.
- Added device specific styles to achieve some of the above goals:
    - Mobile (up to 768px)
    - Tablet (768px to 1024px)
    - Desktop (1024px and up)
- Arranged the styles in the correct order i.e. starting with styles for mobile devices, followed by styles for tablets, and ending with styles for desktops.
- Used Flexbox layout method to arrange the hero and card sections.
