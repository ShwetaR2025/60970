<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Analysis of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.seva.org/site/SPageServer/">'seva.org'</a>&nbsp; website</strong></span></h1>
<p>Analysis was conducted based on CRAP principles:</p>
<h2>Contrast and Repetition&nbsp;</h2>
<p><img src="images/color-contrast.png" alt="" />The font size of 'seva.org' is unlike other website that I have been on. The organization's name and logo are small compared to other websites such as Unesco or World health organization.</p>
<p>Although I do think the logo design does capture viewer attention.</p>
<p>The contrast of orange for certain tabs like donate, give today and subscribe establish a pattern for the viewer that these are tabs for those who want to engage with the organization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The background of white against which the image in a colored rectangle is layed out.</p>
<p>As we navigate the website the 'Heading 2' use "deep pink" color against a white background.&nbsp; When colored background is used then white colored font is used against colored background .&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we navigate the website the&nbsp;Visual Elements have the same treatment&nbsp; and caption style. The brand / website logo and tag line is present on the top of the page left hand corner&nbsp; and the tabs labelled "gift of sight" and "donate" making them constant&nbsp;icon and reminder of the purpose of the website.</p>
<p>Repetition of the colors and font size for headings and content provided enables the viewer to scan through the website effectively. The Seva website does this very well.</p>

<h2>Alignment&nbsp;</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">As a viewer scrlling down to the contents on the main page of the website, alignment of content was interesting to observe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">The first image on the website is in a rectangular box that works as a frame for the text and image. The text is 'left edge aligned' and image is 'right edge aligned' in the rectangle. Though, the rectangle is centered on the page.</span><span style="font-size: 14px;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">The end of the first page, the text is left aligned and the image is to the right without a rectangle frame or colored background.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">Subsequent visuals are center-aligned with the heading above the image are also centered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">Visual Alignment in the webpage seems to have been paid attention to such as :</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 14px;"> Aligning images with text baselines&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14px;"> Consistent positioning of headings<br /><br /></span></li>
</ul>

<h2>Proximity</h2>
<p>Visual Grouping is evident as Headings sre placed near their<br />corresponding content meadning that the headings are relevant to the supporting information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>White space or very pale color (similar to white) space are used to separate different topics. This enables a viewer the ability to visually know that content topic is changing. White spaces and use of color space have been used appropriately to mark clear breaks between content&nbsp;sections and indication of topic change. different types of information</p>
<p>In the "ways to give" tab distinct spacing for different types of information has been used. Same thing with the "get involved tab.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Functional Grouping in the "get involved tab" permits viewer the ability to navigate the different ways to support Seva.org. On thsi page, the navigation elements grouped together.</p>
<p>The contact information or metadata grouped consistently on each page.&nbsp;</p>
